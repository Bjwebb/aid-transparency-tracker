Before the January up-date the PSD was even more misleading.

In other Natural Resources PSDs the 'green' (efficiency, remediation, gas flaring reductions) investment costs are not specified, eg.: http://www.ebrd.com/english/pages/project/psd/2013/44927.shtml or http://www.ebrd.com/english/pages/project/psd/2013/45184.shtml, apart from the small Technical Cooperation funds.

1. Open license
Korea is a member of OGP and under the governmental open data initiative which was launched in 2013 called \"\"the  government 3.0\"\", all information published by the government is to be shared with open license. 

2, 3. Detailed disaggregated data
 & Bulk export of data
When we see this in terms of the indicator definitions in the guideline paper, the portal site of KOICA contains current information on at least five of the activity-level indicators for the countries and sectors and at least one of indicator for financial information - audit - is published. Thus, I think this criteria is fulfilled either.

But the thing is that KOICA's stat database is not compatible with the portal, as the most current info on the stat is by 2012. This is because KOICA uploads info for the stat site aligned with OECD stats. But, according to the guideline, it is referred as to \"\"the portal or database\"\", which means at least one of those sites is required to fulfill the criteria. 

In this way, it is a little bit hard to say that KOICA publishes current information in a compatible way nor a user-friendly way of presenting info, but it can be seen that the site provides accessible information anyhow.

There are two parts to this indicator. The administrative classification can either be provided as the budget codes themselves, or as a common code that can map from a donor organisation's detailed purpose codes to the recipient country's functional or administrative budget classifications. In addition, the economic classification provides the percentage of the budget that is capital versus current expenditure. This indicator is retained for all organisations in the Index. The budget identifier helps to explain aid flows in the context of the recipient government's own budget. It does not relate only to those flows that are direct to the government (\"\"on budget\"\"), but also to other flows which may relate to the government's own budget. ",,"0"

To ensure credibility, transparency and independence, all evaluations in OCHA are conducted by external experts. All evaluations include a formal management response, which addresses recommendations and identifies follow-up action responsibility. Evaluations in OCHA may be externally or internally mandated.

Additionally, all CERF/ERF/CHF evaluations are published online. CERF also commissions 3-5 individual and independent country reviews each year to determine the added value of CERF in those countries in the past year. These reviews are also published online on the CERF website.",,"0"

For the Emergency Response Funds, please refer to the Global guidelines. For CHFs, each country with a CHF develops allocation guidelines before standard allocations take place. All of these can be found on OCHA's website under each CHF/ERF country specific web page. 

For CERF, there is guidance on how both the Rapid Response (RR) and Underfunded (UFE) windows work. The guidance notes set out the framework for how allocations are undertaken under the two windows (these are on the website and both will be updated this year). 

Additionally, UFE guidance is posted on the website (front page and under the UFE section) before each round.  For UFE allocations (which is a proactive process compared to the reactive nature of the RR window) CERF produces a report that outlines the rationale for the selection of recipient countries and the funding envelopes.",,"0"

An SRP, which is a consolidated inter-agency response plan, should not be a proxy for an OCHA country strategy, which governs how OCHA engages in any given context.

OCHA's own country strategies stem from its 2014-2017 Strategic Plan. These country strategies are internal, and not made public.",,"0"
