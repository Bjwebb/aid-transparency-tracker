In fact, we are the only IFI to disclose information throughout our project lifecycle, and we provide far more comprehensive environmental and social information than any of our peers regarding private sector operations. IFC does not believe that an IATI implementation schedule is an accurate measure of an organization’s commitment to greater transparency. We do not accept a transparency ranking index that places undue weight on IATI, which has yet to provide any information regarding how stakeholders are using the information it publishes. As noted by IATI’s own internal evaluation, questions persist about both IATI governance and the usability and effectiveness of IATI data.

I don't think MCC should be docked for having info on ""only"" two evaluations available for Senegal.  This conforms to the M&E plan (https://assets.mcc.gov/documents/ME_Plan_-_SEN_-_V3_-_Oct15.pdf).  According to this plan, baseline data should have been conducted but the other pieces would only just be underway now or in the future.  The baseline report is actually there on the evaluation catalog, as are questionnaires, etc. for later stages of the evaluation.  It may be the case that not all evaluations are posted within a reasonable timeframe (and indeed, my co-author and I found that to be the case: http://www.cgdev.org/publication/ft/focus-results-mccs-model-practice-brief), but the Senegal example is not, in my opinion, a good one.  Tanzania should have 8 evaluations, according to the M&E plan: https://assets.mcc.gov/documents/ME_Plan_-_TZA_-_V5_-_Post-Compact.pdf.  Two of these were supposed to have a report available in 2015.  It looks like documents related to all 7 evaluations are available in the catalog (because I think 3 of the evaluations listed in the M&E plan are subsumed into one Evaluation Catalog entry).  The final reports for the two that were supposed to be published in 2015, however, do not appear to be available.  So the ""sometimes"" designation is still probably fair.",1,not published

so as to promote better awareness and understanding of its strategies, policies and
operations. At the same time, the PIP establishes clear lines of demarcation to
distinguish information which is made publicly available (either on a routine basis or
upon request) from information which may not be disclosed on the grounds of being
confidential. This is to ensure that mutual trust is maintained between the Bank, its
business clients, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.

The 3rd sub-criteria under criteria 2 (limitations) is a not defined 'harm test'.

The composition of the panel is now such that UNDP no longer has a majority of its membership, or votes (see Section V.21), thereby significantly strengthening its independence. In addition, the two UNDP panel members are now required to be staff of UNDPs' Ethics Office and Office of Audit and Investigations. We believe these are significant changes that are more in line with international best practices, and would appreciate reassessment of the points given, taking these new measures into account. http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/transparency/information_disclosurepolicy.html ",,not published

Our country evaluations usually cover a five-year span and as French aid to Myanmar has only increased in 2013, we are only expecting the longer-term results and impacts in years to come.  It is also worth mentioning that country evaluations are decided and carried out by DG Trésor together with its counterparts in AFD and MAEDI, taking into account a variety of criteria including (but not limited to) financial flows and the interest of each organisation for specific countries.
Some of the evaluations that were launched last year are currently being reviewed and edited for publication. Moreover, those evaluations which are finalised  are all published on our website.
