strategy,Organisation strategy,publication,organisation,planning,"An overarching strategy document explains the general approach and policies of the donor towards international development. This should be forward looking. 
At a minimum, the document should outline which countries, sectors or themes the donor organisation supports, what budget it anticipates spending on the various sectors, countries or themes and what kind of activities it plans to implement and/or support."
annual-report,Annual report,publication,organisation,planning,"Annual reports outline basic (normally aggregate) information about how aid was spent in the previous year, broken down by sector and / or country. This should be backward looking. 
Annual reports which are up to date within their regular cycle, i.e. the organisation publishes an annual report a year behind, the most recent document within this time frame are accepted."
allocation,Allocation policy,publication,organisation,planning,"Aid allocation policies and procedures are the detailed policy and procedure documents by which the organisation chooses where to spend its resources, i.e. on which countries or themes rather than others. Relatively general documents or webpages outlining which countries, themes and institutions the agency will fund are accepted, as long as this is forward-looking and not wholly retrospective."
procurement-policy,Procurement policy,publication,organisation,planning,"An organisation's procurement procedures explain the process used to tender and contract (invite bids for) goods and services. This must fully explain the criteria on which decisions are made, and could be in a single procurement policy document or attached to each tender."
country-strategy,Country strategy,publication,organisation,planning,"A country strategy paper sets out the organisation's planned approach and activities in the recipient country. For it to be accepted it needs to be a detailed document, rather than just a paragraph on the organisation's website."
