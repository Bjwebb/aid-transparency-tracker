foia,FOIA,commitment,,,"The definition used in the Global RTI Rating is that it has to be a law in the strict sense, it must include the right of access to information, this right has to be enforceable and there must be complaint, court and high court appeal possibilities. Decrees are included if they meet the same standards. In addition, the FOIA must be in use for at least the executive part of the government; therefore, FOIAs which are only adopted, approved or still in draft form are not counted. For multilateral donors, international finance institutions (IFIs) and private foundations, a disclosure or transparency policy is accepted as equivalent to a FOIA. Publish What You Fund completes an assessment of the quality of these disclosure policies based on the overarching approach taken in the Global RTI Rating.",1,1
accessibility,Accessibility,commitment,,,"The overall accessibility of aid information through the organisationsﾒ portals, project databases or searchable data sources. These are scored using three criteria: 1) the portal allows free, bulk export of data; 2) it contains detailed disaggregated data; 3) the data is published under an open licence. Data sources are the organisationsﾒ own aid portals, publicly accessible databases or websites ﾖ accessed in that order. The portal or database must include information on current activities for the countries or sectors the organisation is working in rather than just one individual country/sector. It should contain information on at least five of the activity-level indicators, at least one of which should cover financial information. The same data source is used for all three checks. For example, if the aid portal does not state that the data is published under an open licence, this will not be checked elsewhere on the organisationﾒs project database or website. If the organisationﾒs website is the data source then it cannot score on the ﾓfree bulk exportﾔ criterion. 
If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data.

implementation-schedules,Implementation schedules,commitment,,,The Busan Partnership agreement required schedules for implementing the common standard to be published by December 2012. Publish What You Fund conducted an assessment of the schedules completed by development providers and submitted to the OECD common standard implementation website. Schedules are scored on the level of ambition shown by organisations in implementing the IATI component of the common standard.,2,1
dates-actual,Actual dates,publication,activity,basic,"These are the dates that the activity actually started (and ended on, if the activity has finished). If there is only one set of dates but they are not explicitly stated as planned or actual dates, then it is assumed they are planned dates. Actual dates are accepted where specific events occurred, e.g. the date the project/programme agreement is signed, a board presentation or an appraisal date. Both month and year are required to score on this indicator in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.",17,0
contact-details,Contact details,publication,activity,basic,"This shows who can be contacted in relation to this activity. This does not have to be the contact information for an individual or project manager and could refer to a central contact or information desk. Contacts for either the funding organisation or the implementing organisation were accepted.This has to be stated alongside the activity or on an obvious ﾓcontact usﾔ link alongside the activity.

description,Description,publication,activity,basic,"The description of the activity is a descriptive text, longer than the title, explaining what the activity is. Sometimes it is just a short sentence but could also be more detailed. Either is accepted. The description of the activity needs to contain a minimum of 10 words in order to be considered a description rather than just a title.",15,0
implementer,Implementer,publication,activity,basic,"The implementer of the activity is the organisation which is principally responsible for delivering this activity.This information may not be available in all cases due to ﾓlegitimate exclusionsﾔ. For example, humanitarian agencies may not be able to reveal who the implementing agencies are due to security reasons. Such exclusions are accepted but need to be explicitly stated (in order to distinguish these from cases of simple omission).",12,0
dates-planned,Planned dates,publication,activity,basic,"The planned dates are the dates that the activity is scheduled to start and end on. If there are one set of dates but they are not explicitly planned or actual dates, given that these are for activities which are current (i.e. being implemented at the time of data collection) it is assumed that they are planned dates. Both month and year are required to score on this indicator in recognition of recipient countries needing to be able to map activities to their own financial year rather than the calendar year.If the activity has started or has finished, the original planned start and end dates must be retained in addition to the actual dates in order to score on this indicator.

unique-id,Unique ID,publication,activity,basic,"The activity identifier is a unique reference ID for the activity, e.g. a project number. It allows an activity to be referred to and searched for by a code, which can be used to retrieve the project from a database or filing system. The project ID must be stated clearly on the page. It is not sufficient if it is only stated in the URL. It must be numeric or alpha-numeric.",13,0
aid-type,Aid Type,publication,activity,classifications,"The type of aid shows whether the activity is classed as budget support, a project, technical assistance, debt relief, administrative costs, and so on. This needs to be explicitly stated per activity, or once in a country strategy paper or on a clear place on the organisationﾒs website if there is only one aid type for the whole organisation, e.g. ﾓall aid is project-type interventionsﾔ. The advisory services business line/type of intervention (investment climate, public-private partnership, etc.), can be seen as broadly equivalent. 
Statements clarifying business line/intervention type published anywhere on the organisationﾒs website count towards publishing aid type in the web format.

finance-type,Finance Type,publication,activity,classifications,"The type of finance shows whether the activity is a grant, loan, export credit or debt relief. This needs to be explicitly stated per activity, or once in a country strategy paper or clearly on the organisationﾒs website if there is only one finance type for the whole organisation, e.g. ﾓall aid is grantsﾔ. Investment type (loan, equity, etc.) can be interpreted as equivalent.Statements clarifying investment type published anywhere on the website count towards publishing finance type in the web format.

sector,Sector,publication,activity,classifications,"The sectors of the activity explain whether this is, for example, a health or education project. It does not count if it is just mentioned incidentally within the title, description, etc. It needs to be stated separately and explicitly. If projects are presented by sector on an organisationﾒs website, it must be clearly stated whether the organisation works only in those sectors that are listed.",24,0
location,Sub-national location,publication,activity,classifications,"The sub-national geographic location is information about where the activity is located within a country. This may be a province or city, or it could be geo-coded (whereby the precise longitude and latitude is published). It needs to be stated separately and explicitly. For activities that are relevant at a country or regional level, information on the location where the funds are sent to or where the recipient is located will be accepted for this indicator. For example, capital city for a country, or location information of the implementing organisation. This includes private sector investment, loans or debt relief payments, where the location of the relevant bank or organisation is accepted.",25,0
tied-aid-status,Tied Aid Status,publication,activity,classifications,"The tied aid status shows whether the organisation states that this activity counts as ﾓtiedﾔ (procurement is restricted to the donor organisation country) or ﾓuntiedﾔ (open procurement). Specifying location requirements in activity documents such as procurement policies or tenders is accepted as publishing tied aid status. For organisationsﾒ lending directly to national investment agencies, an explicit statement demonstrating their aid is not tied is required. For IFIs and DFIs, investment codes clarifying their position are accepted. For private foundations, grant-making policies are accepted. If these are not available, the organisationﾒs procurement policy must clearly state if there are any eligibility requirements for contracts based on country of origin.

expenditure-actual,Disbursements and expenditure,publication,activity,financial,"Individual actual financial disbursements must be related to individual activities and must be on a per-transaction basis. Each activity is likely to have several transactions. While such information might be considered to be commercially sensitive by some organisations, Publish What You Fundﾒs view is that actual expenditure information is less sensitive once the money has been spent. Hence all organisations are scored on this indicator. For IFIs and DFIs, the total fund/loan amount is accepted and details of the loan repayment costs and related charges can be redacted. The specific reasons for the redactions need to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.",35,0
cost-overall,Budget,publication,activity,financial,"The budget of the activity is the breakdown of the total financial commitment to the activity into annual or quarterly chunks. In order to score for this indicator, the budget for at least the next year ahead (i.e. until 31 December 2014) or until the end of the activity ﾖ whichever is sooner ﾖ should be available with a further breakdown by quarter. For organisations where this may be deemed as commercially sensitive information, total estimated cost of fund/grant/loan amount is accepted or sections within a document can be redacted. The specific reasons for the redactions need to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.",33,0
expenditure-planned,Commitments,publication,activity,financial,This refers to the financial commitment for the activity as a whole for the lifetime of the activity. This is generally a high level commitment rather than a detailed breakdown of the activity budget.,34,0
budget-identifier,Budget Identifier,publication,activity,financial,"The budget classification is a way of linking the activity to the recipient country governmentﾒs own budget codes. There are two parts to this indicator. The administrative classification can either be provided as the budget codes themselves, or as a common code that can map from a donor organisationﾒs detailed purpose codes to the recipient countryﾒs functional or administrative budget classifications. In addition, the economic classification provides the percentage of the budget that is capital versus current expenditure. This indicator is retained for all organisations in the Index. The budget identifier helps to explain aid flows in the context of the recipient government's own budget. It does not relate only to those flows that are direct to the government (""on budget""), but also to other flows which may relate to the government's own budget. In cases where the organisation is only providing private sector investment, budget classifications are still possible. Such activities could, for example, be classified as current expenditure under the microfinance and financial services function.",36,0
conditions,Conditions,publication,activity,performance,"The terms and conditions of the activity may also be referred to as benchmarks, priors, or involve words such as ﾓsubject to...ﾔ. They are specific to an individual activity and explain what the recipient must do in order to be eligible for the funds to be released. The conditions should include loan repayment terms if the activity is financed by a loan. For IFIs and DFIs, this includes loan repayment conditions or special terms and conditions. In cases where the loan repayment terms are considered commercially sensitive, this information can be redacted. The reason for the redactions needs to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published. For private foundations and humanitarian agencies, statements setting out what the grant can be spent on are accepted. Templates for general terms and conditions are not accepted for scoring this indicator. If there are no policy, performance or fiduciary conditions associated with an activity, this must be explicitly stated. ",39,0
impact-appraisals,Impact Appraisals,publication,activity,performance,"Pre-project impact appraisals explain the totality of positive and negative, primary and secondary effects expected to be produced by a development intervention. Environmental impact assessments as well as impact assessments which explain what objectives the project itself intends to provide are accepted. IFIs and DFIs tend only to publish impact appraisals if regulations require them to, but given the link they have to the eventual impact and results of the activity, all organisations included in the Index are scored on this indicator. For loans or private sector investment, risk assessments and the fiscal objectives detailed in the loan document are accepted. These need to be sufficiently detailed and include any criteria used to assess eligibility for receiving the loan. Humanitarian Implementation Plans (HIPs) and project plans are accepted for humanitarian agencies.",38,0
results,Results,publication,activity,performance,The results show whether activities achieved their intended outputs in accordance with the stated goals or plans. This information often refers to logframes and results chains and may be within a specific results or evaluation section of the organisationﾒs website. Both current and completed activities will be considered for this indicator. If the activity is ongoing then the expected results should be available. If the activity has ended then the actual results should be available within 12 months of ending. ,37,0
budget,Budget Docs,publication,activity,related-documents,"This is a specific budget detailing what the intended spending is for the different lines of the individual activity. It is often a document published on the organisationﾒs website. Budget documents cannot simply be at the country level. If an activity budget is included in a larger country-level document, it is only accepted if the budget for the activity is broken down line by line. For organisations where budget documents might be considered commercially sensitive, documents with redactions of the commercially sensitive pieces of information are accepted but the specific reasons for the redactions need to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.",30,0

This could be on a procurement section of the organisationﾒs website, on a separate website or on a central government procurement website. Contract documents cannot simply be at the country level. If an activity contract is included in a larger country-level document, it is only accepted if the contract mentions the activity specifically and in detail. Basic information about the activity contract is accepted if it contains three of the following five information items: awardee, amount, overview of services being provided, start/end dates, unique reference to original tender documents. ",31,0
evaluations,Evaluations,publication,activity,related-documents,"Evaluation documents consider what the activity achieved, whether the intended objectives were met, what the major factors influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the objectives were and an assessment of the impact, effect and value of the activity. This information may be on a specific evaluation section of the organisationﾒs website. If the activity under assessment is not completed but evaluation documents are available for other completed activities, the organisation can score for this indicator. Not all organisations carry out evaluations for all of their activities. Organisations can score on this indicator as long as they publish evaluations within their regular evaluation cycles, i.e. the organisation publishes country evaluations every three years, the most recent documents within this time frame are accepted. ",28,0
mou,MoU,publication,activity,related-documents,"A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a document which details the agreement usually between the organisation and recipient government for the provision of aid in the country.

tenders,Tenders,publication,activity,related-documents,"Tenders are the individual contracts or proposals that have been put out to invite bids from companies or organisations that want to provide goods and services for an activity. They may be on a separate website, possibly on a central government procurement website. Investment codes or policies for IFIs and DFIs are accepted. For private foundations, calls for grant submissions are accepted. For humanitarian agencies, documents that provide guidance on securing funding are accepted. Due to the difficulty with manually finding tenders linked to current activities, rather than looking for the specific tender, a review of the organisationﾒs overall calls for tenders will be completed to check it is publishing them consistently and in-line with their procurement policy. For organisations that do not issue tenders related to aid projects (e.g. if procurement is undertaken by grantees or other implementing agencies), a statement explicitly clarifying this is required.  ",32,0
audit,Audit,publication,organisation,financial,"The organisationﾒs annual audit of its activities is an official inspection of the accounts and activities of this organisation, typically by an independent body. Audits up to date with regular audit cycles are accepted, i.e. if the organisation publishes biennial audits, the most recent document within this time frame is accepted. A formally approved audit of annual accounts is required to score on this indicator. Audits conducted by official government agencies such as State Audit Offices or Controller General Reports are accepted for this indicator.",11,0
total-budget,Total budget,publication,organisation,financial,"The total organisation budget is the total amount that the organisation will be allocated by the government or its funders per year for the next three years. This is money going to the organisation and can be indicative. Each year ahead is worth one third of the total possible score for this indicator. Aggregate budgets of between 2ﾖ3 years will be scored the same as 1 year forward budgets. IFIs and DFIs do not have budgets allocated to them as traditional aid agencies do. In many cases, total budgets are established annually, once total financial figures of all investments are taken into account. However, they do have projected total spend figures that they sometimes publish. If published, these projected figures are accepted for this indicator. Similarly, for private foundations and humanitarian agencies, indicative figures of available funds are accepted. ",9,1
country-budgets,Country budgets,publication,organisation,financial,"The organisationﾒs annual forward planning budget for assistance is the disaggregated budget that the organisation or agency will spend on different countries, programmes and institutions per year, for at least the next three years. The figure could be indicative.  Scores are awarded on the basis of the number of years (up to three years) for which organisations are publishing budget information. Each year ahead is worth 33.33 points out of a total possible score of 100. Aggregate budgets of between 2ﾖ3 years will be scored the same as 1 year forward budgets. Both country budgets or thematic budgets are accepted for organisations that prioritise their work by countries. Projected figures disaggregated along thematic and sectoral priorities, at a near similar level of detail to total organisation budgets are accepted. IFIs and DFIs sometimes publish ﾓroad mapsﾔ which contain this information. The start and end date for forward budgets are calculated based on organisations' fiscal years. Budgets need to run up to a minimum of December 2016 to score for 'three years forward'. Organisations at the end of their fixed budget cycles and therefore without a published budget for the next three years do not receive points for this indicator. Forward Spending Survey data reported to the OECD DAC is taken into account only if it is available for the specific organisation under assessment. ",10,1
strategy,Organisation strategy,publication,organisation,planning,"An overarching strategy document explains the general approach and policies of the organisation towards international development.

annual-report,Annual report,publication,organisation,planning,"Annual reports outline basic (normally aggregate) information about how aid was spent in the previous year, broken down by sector and/or country. This should be backward looking. Annual reports which are up to date within their regular cycle, i.e. the organisation publishes an annual report a year behind, the most recent document within this time frame are accepted. To score for this indicator, the annual report needs to include details of where the organisation is spending its resources and the information needs to be forward looking, i.e. cover current activity period.",5,0
allocation,Allocation policy,publication,organisation,planning,"Aid allocation policies are the detailed policy documents by which the organisation chooses where to spend its resources, i.e. on which countries or themes rather than others. Relatively general documents or web pages outlining which countries, themes and institutions the agency will fund are accepted, as long as this is forward looking and not wholly retrospective. For organisations such as IFIs and private foundations which do not have an ﾓaid allocationﾔ policy, equivalent documents are accepted; for example, ﾓinvestment strategy/policyﾔ or ﾓgrant-making policyﾔ.

This must fully explain the criteria on which decisions are made, and could be in a single procurement policy document or attached to each tender. For IFIs which are often demand-driven, this is understood as their investment policy. For private foundations, this is their grant making policy. For organisations that do not undertake procurement related to aid projects (e.g. if procurement is undertaken by grantees or other implementing agencies), a statement explicitly clarifying this is required, as well as the overall policy for procuring goods and services at the headquarter level.
