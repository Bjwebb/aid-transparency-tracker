for a subset of tests, we can manually access external data or whatever

for a specific organisation we care about the activities which match
these tests

gate:
for each organisation, for each test:
    total passes >= 1

if gate:
    select activity ids
    take a random sample of these

    |> obtain relevant xml files
    |> relevant xml fragments

there are about 3 boolean questions to be answered by a human @ pwyf

forall such questions
   forall sampled activities
       store(answer)

four types of test:
    document link
    result
    subnational location

generate work items
view list of work items
do work item

zero the test when the sample fails
